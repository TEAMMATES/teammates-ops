  * [Snr Developer](#snr-developer)
  * [Project Lead](#project-lead)

Refer to [this page](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.jsp) for the current lineup of the community.

## Contributor

Contributors are community members who give small but noteworthy contributions (typically bug reports, bug fixes, enhancements, documentation updates) to the project, on a no-strings-attached basis.
TEAMMATES welcome any developer (especially student) to be a contributor to the project, with no expectation of commitment or skill set.

Contributors:
* Have "pull" access to the main repository and the ops repository, and submit their fixes via pull requests (PRs) from their own forked repository.
  The detailed workflow is given in [this document](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/process.html).
* Can open issues.
* Can close issues and PRs opened by themselves.
* Can comment on any issue and PR.

Contributors who have shown contributions sustained over a long period of time will be duly recognized as **major contributors**, and will be invited to join the TEAMMATES organization. Major contributors:
* Have "triage" access to the main repository.
* Can be assigned or assign themselves to issues.
* Can label and close any issue as they see fit.
* Can label PRs opened by themselves.
* Can assign reviewers to PRs authored by themselves.

## Committer

Committers are community members who have shown:
* Significant contributions beyond that of contributors,
* Good knowledge of TEAMMATES both as a product and a project, and
* Commitment to continue contributing for a longer period of time.

On top of contributor's privileges, committers:
* Have "push" access to the main repository and has the option to submit their fixes via PRs from the main repository.
* Can be assigned or assign themselves to review PRs.
* Can merge approved PRs authored by themselves.

## Core team member

Core team members are community members who have shown significant and sustained contributions and knowledge beyond that of committers,
and are trusted to be responsible for determining the direction of the project for a set period of time.
They are expected to be familiar with the development workflow.

On top of committer's privileges, core team members:
* Can label and close any PR as they see fit.
* Can merge approved PRs reviewed by themselves.
* Have access to maintainer's features in the live server.

Core team members are expected to:
* Maintain the project velocity:
  * Continue to contribute to the code base themselves or guide more junior members in their attempts to handle issues.
  * Respond to community members trying to reach the project team members, e.g. requesting for help.
* Cover all of [maintainer's duties](maintainer-guide.md).

Core team members can progress through various ranks, with different duties involved in those ranks.

> Core team members are synonymous with *project maintainers*, a term more commonly used in other software projects.

### Snr Developer

Snr developers are the most junior members of the core team.
They do not have additional duties other than that common to all core team members.

### Project Lead

> This title is used interchangeably with *Team Lead*; they both refer to the same position.

Project leads are team members who oversee the entire project velocity and ensure its continuity and maintainability.

Project leads have the following additional privileges:
* Have "admin" access to the main repository and the ops repository.
* Can assign reviewers to any PR.
* Can merge any approved PR.

Project leads have the following duties:
* Manage weekly release (i.e. act as Release Lead). Can also be delegated to other team members.
* Make sure that all of maintainer's duties are covered by the team.

### Project Mentor

Project mentors are experienced past team members or domain/industry experts who take on advisory role for current team members.
They are not obliged to actively contribute code to the project or perform maintenance tasks.

Project mentors who are promoted from a previous team member position will retain all their previous privileges. Otherwise, the privilege is granted on a case-by-case basis.
